Fetch Steam Inventory

Fetch the authenticated user's live CS2 inventory from Steam. Requires a linked Steam account. No data is persisted — use the portfolio import endpoint to add items to a portfolio.

### Example

* Bearer Authentication (BearerAuth):

```python
import cs2cap_sdk
from cs2cap_sdk.models.steam_inventory_response import SteamInventoryResponse
from cs2cap_sdk.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

# Defining the host is optional and defaults to https://api.cs2c.app
# See configuration.py for a list of all supported configuration parameters.
configuration = cs2cap_sdk.Configuration(
    host = "https://api.cs2c.app"
)

# The client must configure the authentication and authorization parameters
# in accordance with the API server security policy.
# Examples for each auth method are provided below, use the example that
# satisfies your auth use case.

# Configure Bearer authorization: BearerAuth
configuration = cs2cap_sdk.Configuration(
    access_token = os.environ["BEARER_TOKEN"]
)

# Enter a context with an instance of the API client
with cs2cap_sdk.ApiClient(configuration) as api_client:
    # Create an instance of the API class
    api_instance = cs2cap_sdk.InventoryApi(api_client)

    try:
        # Fetch Steam Inventory
        api_response = api_instance.fetch_steam_inventory()
        print("The response of InventoryApi->fetch_steam_inventory:\n")
        pprint(api_response)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception when calling InventoryApi->fetch_steam_inventory: %s\n" % e)

Fetch Steam Inventory by Steam ID

Fetch the CS2 inventory for any Steam account by Steam64ID or vanity URL. Accepts a 17-digit Steam64ID (e.g. `76561197964243909`) or a custom URL name (e.g. `dadscap`). Vanity URL resolution requires a Steam Web API key to be configured. No data is persisted.
